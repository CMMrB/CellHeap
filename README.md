# CellHeap

CellHeap is a configurable, portable, and robust workflow for scRNA-seq customizable analyses, with quality control throughout the execution steps, ensuring reliable results and deployable on supercomputers. 

CellHeap is composed of six phases: sample curation, gene count matrix generation, quality control, dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis, cell level analysis, and gene level analysis

This repository contains a deployment of CellHeap for a dataset made available by Liao et al. 2020. In that paper, the authors considered 13 patients, from which four patients were controls, 3 presented mild symptoms, and 6 six patients developed severe symptoms of COVID-19. However, when we applied the dataset selection criteria related to phase 1, one dataset was discarded relative to one of the controls.
